Python development project template
==========================

[![Code style: black](https://img.shields.io/badge/code%20style-black-000000.svg)](https://github.com/psf/black)

A template for a Python development project.

[[_TOC_]]



Get going
--------------------------
To start the game write the following command in the terminal :
"python main.py"

This is how you can play the game:
- To get help, write help and it will take you to the help table
- The name can be changed by the command "name" and adding your name after space
- if you want to change the difficulty, write "level easy" for the easy mode and "level hard" for the hard mode
- To start the game you need to write roll.
If you want to hold write hold.
- if you want to roll again, write roll. 

If you want to cheat, write "cheat" command and it will show you the number that is rolled. You can either play it by putting " roll" command 
or hold it by using "hold" command.

Intelligence:
The turns of the computer are randomly generated between 2 and 8.
After randomly selecting, it will roll dice between 1 to 6. 
The turn is finished when it either gets 1 or its number of turns generated before ends. 

Difficulty level:
There are two difficulty levels:
Easy: Allows the player unlimited cheats
Hard: Allows the player only 2 cheats per turn




### Check version of Python

Check what version of Python you have. The Makefile uses `PYTHON=python` as default.

```
# Check you Python installation
make version
```

If you have another naming of the Python executable then you can solve that using an environment variable. This is common on Mac and Linux.

```
# Set the environment variable to be your python executable
export PYTHON=python3
make version
```

Read more on [GNU make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/manual/make.html).



### Python virtual environment

Install a Python virtual environment and activate it.

```
# Create the virtual environment
make venv

# Activate on Windows
. .venv/Scripts/activate

# Activate on Linx/Mac
. .venv/bin/activate
```

When you are done you can leave the venv using the command `deactivate`.

Read more on [Python venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html).



### Install the dependencies

Install the PIP packages that are dependencies to the project and/or the development environment. The dependencies are documented in the `requirements.txt`.

Do not forget to check that you have an active venv.

```
# Do install them
make install

# Check what is installed
make installed
```

Read more on [Python PIP](https://pypi.org/project/pip/).



### Run the code

The example program can be started like this.

```
# Execute the main program
python game/main.py
```

All code is stored below the directory `game/`.



### Run the validators

You can run the static code validators like this. They check the sourcecode and exclude the testcode.

```
# Run each at a time
make flake8
make pylint

# Run all on the same time
make lint
```

You might need to update the Makefile if you change the name of the source directory currently named `guess/`.

Read more on:

* [flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/)
* [pylint](https://pylint.org/)



### Run the unittests

You can run the unittests like this. The testfiles are stored in the `test/` directory.

```
# Run unttests without coverage
make unittest

# Run unittests with coverage
make coverage

# Run the linters and the unittests with coverage
make test
```

You can open a web browser to inspect the code coverage as a generated HTML report.

```
firefox htmlcov/index.html
```

Read more on:

* [unittest](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
* [coverage](https://coverage.readthedocs.io/)



### Run parts of the testsuite

You can also run parts of the testsuite, for examples files or methods in files.

You can run all tests from a testfile.

```
# Run a testfile
python -m unittest test.test_game
```

You can also run a single testcase from a file.

```
# Run a test method, in a class, in a testfile
python -m unittest test.test_game.TestGameClass.test_init_default_object
```



### Remove generated files

You can remove all generated files by this.

```
# Remove files generated for tests or caching
make clean

# Do also remove all you have installed
make clean-all
```



Optional targets
--------------------------

These targets might be helpful when running your project.



### Codestyle with black

You can unify the codestyle using black. Running black will change your source code to have a codestyle according to black codestyle.

```
# Same same, different names
make black
make codestyle
```

More targets
--------------------------

The Makefile contains more targets, they are however not yet tested on this directory structure.
